I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at LIRIS, at the faculty of Economics and Business at **KU Leuven** (Belgium), specializing in the application of **machine learning** within a **process mining** context. 

At the moment, I am working on a **FWO** junior postdoctoral fellowship on robust multimodal prediction in business processes, with prof. Johannes De Smedt and prof. Jochen De Weerdt

I have previosuly worked on a project on process model forecasting. Other projects I have been involved in include among others evaluation metrics of predictive process monitoring solutions, ML-driven conformance checking of process models, and adversarial attacks for robustness checks in predictive process monitoring.

I have succesfully defended my PhD dissertation on "Novel Conformance Checking Methods and Validation Strategies for Deep Learning in Process Mining" in 2023. 

If you want to collaborate, or have any questions about the works I have been involved in, feel free to contact me.
