I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at LIRIS, at the faculty of Economics and Business at **KU Leuven** (Belgium), specializing in the application of **machine learning** within a **process mining** context. At the moment, I am working on a project on process model forecasting with prof. Johannes De Smedt and prof. Jochen De Weerdt. Other projects I have been involved in include among others evaluation metrics of predictive process monitoring solutions, ML-driven conformance checking of process models, and adversarial attacks for robustness checks in predictive process monitoring.
